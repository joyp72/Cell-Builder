				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<p class="desc">The gameplay revolves around the player having to manage resources in order to
					improve their cells. Resource producing organelles may generate one of three key assets:
					DNA, ATP, and protein. DNA is used to upgrade and evolve cells, ATP is used as a fuel
					source, and protein is used to upgrade organelles within the cells. Evolving a cell into its
					next stage unlocks additional organelles that may help increase resource production. <br><br>
					Resource producing organelles will also produce waste for which the player must make
					use of Lysosome organelles in order to dispose of it. If the waste is not removed from the
					producer, it will cease to produce further resources until it is cleared of waste.</p>
