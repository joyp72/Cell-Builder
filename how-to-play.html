				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<p class="desc">The gameplay revolves around the player having to manage resources in order to
					improve their cells. Resource producing organelles may generate one of three key assets:
					DNA, ATP, and protein. DNA is used to upgrade and evolve cells, ATP is used as a fuel
					source, and protein is used to upgrade organelles within the cells. Evolving a cell into its
					next stage unlocks additional organelles that may help increase resource production. <br><br>
					Resource producing organelles will also produce waste for which the player must make
					use of Lysosome organelles in order to dispose of it. If the waste is not removed from the
					producer, it will cease to produce further resources until it is cleared of waste.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="background-container">
				<h2>Controls</h2>
				<p class="desc">The player can move the camera and zoom in or out
					with the mouse. A number of various buttons can be intracted with by using left click mouse button.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="background-container">
				<h2>UI</h2>
				<p class="desc">The playerâ€™s resource count is shown in the top right. <br>
					When an organelle is clicked, it opens up a side
					panel, displaying information about the organelle. <br>
					This side panel has a button to display information
					about the cell, which has a similar button for building
					new organelles.</p>
