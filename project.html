                <h2>Project Backgroud</h2>
				<p class="desc">Knowledge on cells and how they work are a fundamental building block needed
					to understand the world around us. Without understanding cells, you can’t understand any
					other life form, since we’re all made of cells. This has inspired us to make an educational
					game to teach kids about the basics of cells. <br><br>Educational games have the potential to offer
					an experience that is both enlightening and entertaining at the same time to create a
					memorable understanding of the concepts that it is trying to teach to the player.</p>

					<h2>Project Description</h2>
					<p class="vert-desc">The gameplay revolves around the player having to manage resources in order to
					improve their cells. Resource producing organelles may generate one of three key assets:
					DNA, ATP, and protein. <br><br>The game provides a satisfying positive feedback loop, where the player seeks
					to increase their production rate to get more resources by increasing their production rate
					by collecting more resources, and so on.</p>
